# About the app
This is a React-App that uses Spotify's Web Api to fetch data.
There is a search bar, type the name of your favourite artist or any artist.
Click on search button.
You will get the name of your artist with artist's image and number of people following the artist and genre of the artist.
You will also get the top 10 works of the artist(as per spotify).
You can click on the songs sung by the artist and you'll here a oart of song for 30 seconds(spotify doesn't allow more than that...I know that's sad).
Enjoy the music.

# How to use code
You have to generate access token using the spotify authentication doc available on github.You can easily clone that.
Put it in the code and you are ready to go.
